# Implementation: T-10 — Add metrics dashboard section and Slice 4 tracker fields to spec-protocol.md

**Date:** 2026-02-18

## Changes Made

- `.claude/skills/spec-protocol.md`: Three additions made to the existing document.

  1. **Cross-reference note in Section 12** — Added a blockquote after the existing Slice applicability note, pointing readers to the new Section 18 for Slice 4 extended fields.

  2. **Slice 4 Extended Fields table in Section 12** — Inserted a new subsection `#### Slice 4 Extended Fields (Optional)` immediately after the cross-reference note and before the `### Complete File Example` block. The table documents six optional fields: `tier`, `token_budget`, `token_spent`, `entropy_score`, `assertions_total`, `assertions_passing`.

  3. **New Section 18: Metrics Dashboard (Slice 4)** — Added at the end of the file, after the Section 17 Tier Applicability table and separator. Covers four subsections: Token Tracking (85% alert threshold, tier budgets), Assertion Metrics (pass rate formula and target), Entropy Score (formula and thresholds), Spec Quality Metrics (vague term rate, double-entry compliance, file scope accuracy), and When to Use (optional for Slice 1-2, recommended for MODERATE+ in Slice 4).

## Decisions Made During Implementation

- Section number 18 was chosen (not a generic "N") because the file already had Sections 1-17 with no gaps; using 18 keeps numbering consistent and avoids placeholder text in the live file.
- The cross-reference note was added as a blockquote immediately after the existing Slice applicability blockquote, keeping both governance notes together rather than splitting them.
- The Slice 4 Extended Fields table was placed inside Section 12 (before the Complete File Example) rather than at the end of Section 12, so it stays close to the base schema it extends. This makes the extension self-documenting in context.
- Entropy score formula uses `spec_amendments + respec_count` as the numerator — consistent with the NEEDS_RESPEC mechanism already defined in Sections 13 and 15.

## Testing

- Read back both insertion points after editing to confirm correct placement and no text corruption.
- Verified the Section 18 header renders as `## 18. Metrics Dashboard (Slice 4)` with the correct separator `---` above it.
- Verified the cross-reference reads: `> See Section 18 (Metrics Dashboard) for Slice 4 extended fields and tracking capabilities.`
- Verified the extended fields table has six rows matching the task specification exactly.

## Assertion Results

- A1: PASS — `.claude/skills/spec-protocol.md` line 774 (Slice 4 Extended Fields table added to Section 12)
- A2: PASS — `.claude/skills/spec-protocol.md` line 772 (cross-reference blockquote added after `phase` field table in Section 12)
- A3: PASS — `.claude/skills/spec-protocol.md` line 1381 (Section 18 Metrics Dashboard added as last section of file)

## Status
