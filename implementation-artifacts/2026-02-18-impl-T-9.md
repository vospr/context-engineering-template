# Implementation: T-9 — Add agent-specific spec views to CLAUDE.md dispatch Step 5

**Date:** 2026-02-18

## Changes Made

- `CLAUDE.md`: Added SDD Spec Views sub-section to Step 5 (Dispatch). Four bullet points describe role-filtered spec packet views dispatched to planner, implementer, reviewer, and tester when `spec-protocol.md` exists. Change adds 4 lines; file grows from 145 to 150 lines (well under the 200-line constraint).

## Decisions Made During Implementation

- Placed the SDD Spec Views block as a third bullet inside Step 5, immediately after the existing two bullets. This keeps it co-located with the dispatch action without needing a new heading (which would cost extra lines).
- Parenthetical rationale added per role ("planner authors them", "tester verifies, not interprets") for fast in-context comprehension without requiring a reader to cross-reference the research doc.
- Wording mirrors the research document Section 4 table but is condensed to one line per role to stay within the CLAUDE.md style of terse bullet points.

## Testing

- Verified final line count is 150 (read file after edit, confirmed last line is 150).
- Confirmed the four role-view entries match Section 4 of `planning-artifacts/2026-02-18-research-slice4-complete-specification.md`:
  - Planner: version + intent + title (excludes assertions, evidence)
  - Implementer: full spec packet
  - Reviewer: version + intent + assertions + file_scope + evidence report
  - Tester: assertions + file_scope + constraints (excludes intent)

## Status
