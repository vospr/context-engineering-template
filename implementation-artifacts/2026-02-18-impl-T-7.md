# Implementation: T-7 — Patch agent definitions with Epic 5 audit gaps

**Date:** 2026-02-18

## Changes Made

- `.claude/agents/planner.md`: Expanded the `## SDD Spec Authoring` section header to `## SDD Spec Authoring (Permanent Native Capability)` and added a two-sentence clarification note directly beneath it. The note states that spec authoring is a permanent responsibility of the planner and that `spec-protocol.md` is reference material that does not need to be loaded per dispatch. The `spec-protocol` entry in the frontmatter `skills:` field was left untouched.

- `.claude/agents/tester.md`: Replaced the single compressed prose line in the Integration Verification Mode `### Output` section with an explicit two-point structured list (`**Output sections:**`) naming the cross-task interaction table and the feature acceptance checklist with their column/status formats, followed by an explicit escalation instruction for CONFLICT findings.

## Decisions Made During Implementation

- The planner note was inserted as the first paragraph under the new header, before the existing `When SDD mode is active...` sentence, so the clarification is immediately visible and the existing workflow text flows naturally after it.
- The tester output was reformatted as a numbered list rather than prose to match the explicitness requested in the audit and to align with the structured table format already used elsewhere in tester.md.
- No other lines were modified in either file to keep the diff minimal and reviewable.

## Testing

- Read back both edited regions to confirm exact text matches the intended output.
- Verified planner.md line 64 shows the updated header and lines 65-67 show the new clarification paragraph.
- Verified tester.md lines 99-103 show the structured `**Output sections:**` block replacing the old prose line.

## Status
