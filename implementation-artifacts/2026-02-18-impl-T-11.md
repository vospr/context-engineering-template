# Implementation: T-11 — Update planner.md to reference spec-templates in spec authoring workflow
**Date:** 2026-02-18

## Changes Made
- `.claude/agents/planner.md`: Inserted new step 3 "Template consumption" between gap detection (step 2) and write spec packets (now step 4). Renumbered the original steps 3-6 to 4-7 to maintain sequential numbering.

## Decisions Made During Implementation
- Kept the new step on a single numbered list line (no sub-heading) to match the existing style of the workflow list and avoid bloating the file.
- Inlined all four constraints (check, adapt, verify, fallback) into the one line rather than adding a sub-bullet block, keeping planner.md concise per the task requirement.
- Marked the step "(optional)" to make clear it is a progressive enhancement — absence of the directory is the safe default.

## Testing
- Read the full file after edits to confirm step numbering is sequential (1-7) with no duplicate numbers.
- Confirmed surrounding sections (Gap Detection, Just-in-Time Decomposition, Pre-Spec Checks) are unmodified.

## Status
COMPLETED
